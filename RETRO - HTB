Download the file from hack the box

Unzip file and you will get a jpg.

We need to binwalk this. binwalk -e .jpg

In the extracted file you will see a wav file

To decode this you need turgen. Open turgen on the terminal and use the code 

java -jar turgen.jar

here turgen will open.

Then you will need to go into tools then turbo decoder

Open your wav file and save to your choice of preference.

Attach the decoder, make sure its set as universal decoder

Also make sure monitor mode is ticked.

Then once that is all set up you your ready.

This can be played around a bit but try set your navigation to either low or high (this will depend on the file) I figured out working low works for this

Then Decode until EOF, then change the navigation (low or high) than decode one file.

Now hopefully you got the flag from that.

And to check you should go to where the file was dowloaded to.

And use strings.

strings *./tm (because its a .tm file) and there should be the flag!!!
